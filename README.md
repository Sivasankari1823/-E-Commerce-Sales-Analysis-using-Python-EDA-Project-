‚Ä¢	South: $307.23K (24.47%)

‚Ä¢	East: $301.63K (24.02%)

This balanced regional performance suggests effective nationwide market penetration.

### Customer Insights ###

Gender Analysis:

Average unit prices show no significant gender bias, with both male and female customers spending approximately $500 per unit on average. This indicates the product mix appeals equally to both demographics.

Purchase Patterns:

The data shows consistent customer engagement with an average of 4 items per transaction across the sample, suggesting customers are making substantial purchases rather than single-item buys.
Time Trends

Year-over-Year Growth:

‚Ä¢	2024: $669,125 in sales with 1,302 units sold

‚Ä¢	2025 (partial year): $586,380 with 1,150 units sold

The 2025 performance is tracking well considering it's only a partial year, suggesting sustained business momentum.

Monthly Patterns: 

The sales by month chart shows seasonal variations, with some months (particularly around month 10-12) showing stronger performance, likely indicating holiday shopping patterns.
Return Insights

### Return Rate Analysis:###

Return rates vary significantly by category:

‚Ä¢	Clothing: 11.6% (highest return rate)

‚Ä¢	Books: 11.0%

‚Ä¢	Home: 9.2%

‚Ä¢	Electronics: 9.1% (lowest return rate)

Key Observations:

‚Ä¢	Clothing's higher return rate (11.6%) is typical for fashion items due to fit and style preferences

‚Ä¢	Electronics have the lowest return rate (9.1%), indicating good product quality and customer satisfaction

‚Ä¢	The overall return rates are within acceptable e-commerce ranges (8-12%)

### Shipping Status Insights ###
